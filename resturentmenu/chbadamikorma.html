        <h2><b>Per Dish 540</b></h2> <h5>" Introducing our Chicken Badami Korma, a culinary masterpiece that marries the succulence of tender chicken with the richness of badam (almonds). This korma is a celebration of flavors, where the creamy texture and aromatic spices come together to create a truly indulgent experience.

            In crafting our Chicken Badami Korma, we prioritize quality and authenticity. Premium cuts of chicken are slow-cooked to perfection, allowing them to absorb the richness of badam, resulting in a dish that is both hearty and flavorful.
