<h2><b>per plate 780</b></h2><p>  <h4>" Introducing our Beef Badami Korma, a culinary delight that brings together the robust flavor of tender beef with the luscious richness of badam (almonds). This korma is a symphony of taste and texture, where each bite is a journey into the heart of exquisite flavors.

    Crafted with meticulous care, our Beef Badami Korma is a testament to our commitment to quality and authenticity. We carefully select premium cuts of beef, allowing them to slow-cook to perfection and absorb the opulence of badam, resulting in a korma that is both hearty and decadently flavorful.
